# Pomodoro Timer 25+5 

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that divides work into intervals. It involves working for 25 minutes (a Pomodoro) followed by a short break of 5 minutes. After completing four Pomodoros, take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. This technique aims to boost productivity by breaking tasks into manageable chunks and incorporating regular breaks to maintain focus and motivation. Have a fun and productive time!
